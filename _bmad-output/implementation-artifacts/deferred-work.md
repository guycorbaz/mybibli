# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-project-skeleton-and-foundation (2026-03-29)

- DB pool has no connection limits or timeouts — configure `max_connections`, `acquire_timeout`, `idle_timeout` on the pool
- Health check does not verify database connectivity — add DB ping to `/health` endpoint
- `storage_locations` self-referencing FK allows cycles — add application-level cycle detection
- `loans` table allows multiple active loans per volume — enforce single active loan per volume at application level
- Soft-delete not enforced at FK level — by design, all queries must include `deleted_at IS NULL`
- `pending_metadata_updates.session_token` missing FK to `sessions.token` — add FK or document why it's intentionally absent

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-scan-field-and-catalog-page (2026-03-29)

- No CSRF protection on POST /catalog/scan — add CSRF token validation when destructive endpoints are added
- Session token not validated for length/charset before DB lookup — add max length check
- OobUpdate target/content not sanitized in HtmxResponse — currently server-controlled, sanitize if user input ever flows into targets
- scan-field.js prefix overlap: ISSN (977) vs UPC starting with 977 — add disambiguation logic when media types are fully implemented
- Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut hijacks browser address bar shortcut — evaluate alternative shortcut or make configurable
